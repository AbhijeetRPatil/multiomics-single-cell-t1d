# multiomics-single-cell-t1d
Supplementary code for paper

## Running code
Each script is named after an associated figure in the paper. While each script may be run with the appropriate interpreter (`bash` for `.sh` files, `Rscript` for `.R` files, `python` for `.py` files, `stack` for `.hs` files), input files and folders must be changed to represent the location of the raw data on the user's local system. Many of these scripts use `too-many-cells`, which can be download at https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells with instructions and documentation for additional features.
